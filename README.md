# Python and Pandas Practice  

## Introduction  

Once you begin to learn Python, it is essential to continue practicing on a regular basis. There are many free resources to help you practice your Python skills. Practicing your Python skills will help you to be more comfortable in a technical interview and can help you to focus on solving the problems presented rather than the code it will take to solve the problem.

## Objectives  

You will be able to:  

* continue to refine your Python skills through repetition  
* hone your Pandas skills

## Python Practice   

To help refine your Python skills we recommend that you continue to code on a regular basis.  It is a good idea to code a little every day to help to retain the knowledge you have gained.  There are many free resources out there, but here are a few that we feel are useful:

1. [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/python)
2. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/auth/signup?h_r=home&h_l=body_middle_left_button&h_v=1)
3. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
4. 

## Pandas Practice  

A great deal of the Python you have learned uses Pandas as it is an integral part of the data science toolkit.  Just as it is prudent to continue practicing your Python skills, you should also incorporate Pandas into your practice in order to make the working with data in pandas more intuitive.  Following are some helpful resources to facilitate your practice.
